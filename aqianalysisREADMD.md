# AQI-ANALYSIS-HYDERABAD

# Hyderabad Air Quality Analysis 

This project explores and visualizes air quality data for Hyderabad, India, focusing on **AQI (Air Quality Index)** and key pollutants such as **PM10, PM2.5, CO, NOx, SO₂, O₃**, and more. The goal was to identify patterns, understand health impacts, and suggest actionable insights for improving the city's air quality.

---

## Project Objective

> **"To analyze the air quality patterns of Hyderabad and understand how different pollutants impact public health, using Python and data visualization techniques."**

---

## My Approach 

As a Data Science student, I wanted to treat this as a real-world problem. Here's how I approached it:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns (like ID).
   - Standardized columns (e.g., fixed spelling: `mounths4 → months`).
   - Converted `month-year` into readable time format for trend analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified numeric and categorical features.
   - Used **histograms, boxplots, line plots, scatter plots, pie charts**, and **treemaps** to explore data distribution and relationships.

3. **Trend Analysis Over Time**  
   - Analyzed AQI and pollutant trends month-by-month.
   - Observed seasonality and health risks tied to pollutant spikes.

## Visualizations Performed

| Type of Plot       | Purpose                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Line Plot        | To analyze pollutant trends over time               |
| Box Plot         | To view data spread and outliers                    |
| Bar Chart        | For comparing categorical features                  |
| Pie Chart        | To visualize distribution (e.g., AQI categories)    |
| Tree Map         | To show hierarchical frequency of categories        |
| Regression Plot  | To check correlation between pollutants & AQI       |
| Histogram + KDE  | For distribution + shape analysis of numeric data  |

## Why I Used Multiple Plot Types

Different plots help us **look at data from different angles**. For example:
- Line plots show **how things change over time**.
- Box plots reveal **outliers and spread**.
- Regression plots help understand **strength of correlation**.
- Pie charts and treemaps give a **quick glance at categorical proportions**.

> Using one plot type alone would limit the understanding. Combining them helps uncover **hidden trends and relationships**.

---

## Why I Didn't Choose Other Methods

- I avoided **complex machine learning models** here, because my focus was **data interpretation**, not prediction.
- Didn't use **geospatial mapping** since the dataset didn't include coordinates.
- Chose **basic yet powerful plots** over dashboards to keep things **simple and educational**.

---

## Key Insights

- **AQI spikes during winter**, especially Nov–Jan, due to stagnant air and emissions.
- **PM2.5 & PM10** are the most dangerous, showing consistent high levels.
- **Ozone (O₃)** peaks in **summer months** due to photochemical reactions.
- **CO and NOx** levels remain fairly stable but still pose health risks.

---

## Deeper Understanding

By visualizing pollutant trends:
- I understood how **weather, traffic, and human activities** influence air quality.
- I learned how to extract **real-life meaning** from data, not just numbers.
- Correlation plots showed how **each pollutant contributes to AQI**, helping pinpoint what to control.

---

## What Can Be Improved in Hyderabad?

- Promote **public transport** and limit personal vehicle use.
- Ban **construction burning and industrial emissions** during peak months.
- Plant more **green belts** to absorb pollutants.
- Spread **awareness** during high AQI days using mobile alerts and campaigns.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Squarify)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis
- **CSV Dataset** with air quality readings for Hyderabad

---

## Final Thoughts
"This project helped me realize how air quality is more than just a number—it’s a life-impacting measurement. With the power of data, we can inform better decisions and protect our health."


---

## Future Scope

While this project focused on understanding historical air quality in Hyderabad, there's great potential to take it further:

### 1. Predictive Modeling
- Develop machine learning models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **LSTM** to forecast AQI trends.
- Use **time series analysis** to predict spikes and suggest proactive measures.

### 2. Geospatial Insights
- Add **location data** to visualize pollution across Hyderabad neighborhoods using **Folium** or **Plotly maps**.
- Spot high-impact zones and optimize city-level air improvement plans.

### 3. Real-Time Dashboards
- Build interactive **Streamlit** or **Dash** apps to display real-time AQI data and trends.
- Integrate with **public APIs** for live air monitoring and alerts.

### 4. Source Attribution
- Combine AQI with **traffic, industrial activity, and weather data** to analyze pollution sources.
- Understand which pollutants come from where — and when.

### 5. Citizen-Centric Tools
- Create **apps, alerts, and visuals** to inform residents about air quality on a daily basis.
- Suggest **safe outdoor hours**, indoor precautions, or travel plans based on AQI levels.

## ❤Why I Did This Project

“Although I wasn’t born in Hyderabad, I’ve visited it countless times — and that makes the city feel almost like a second home.”

This project started from a simple thought:  
> *“I’ve visited Hyderabad so many times… but how much do I really know about the air I breathe when I’m there?”*

That curiosity quickly turned into a fun and passionate learning journey. I realized that while we often hear about air pollution in cities like Delhi or Mumbai, **Hyderabad doesn’t get much attention in that space** — yet it's growing rapidly and deserves to be part of that conversation.


### What Drove Me

- **Curiosity** – I wanted to explore something close to me using real data.
- **Learning** – This was a perfect opportunity to apply my Python and data science skills.
- **Local Relevance** – It felt great to study something that affects not just the world, but **my city, my surroundings**.
- **Sense of Contribution** – Even if it’s a small analysis, I feel proud knowing it could raise awareness.

I’m fully aware that this project doesn’t solve pollution — but for me, it was about **connecting with the city through data**, learning how to ask meaningful questions, and visualizing answers that matter.

> *Understanding where you live is one of the best uses of data — and this project helped me do just that, one chart at a time.*

## Final Conclusion

After cleaning messy datasets, plotting colorful graphs, and decoding every pollutant from PM10 to O₃, here's what I learned:

> 🌬️ *“Air quality isn’t just data — it’s the air we breathe every day. And data science helps us understand and improve it.”*

Hyderabad, with its vibrant culture and rapid growth, has done remarkably well to manage urban development and air quality. The insights from this project highlight areas to **strengthen even further** — not because we're behind, but because **we care to lead**.

Whether it's dust from traffic, ozone from sunlight, or CO from vehicles — each element in the air tells a story. And as someone from this city, I believe:

> **Hyderabad has the brains, heart, and tech to stay both smart and sustainable.**

So here’s to clearer skies, greener days, and many more student-led data stories that shape a healthier future. 📊🌿
